# 2026-02-22 Increment | news (cleaned)

## Final accepted additions (deduplicated)
Only 3 high-value items were accepted today:
1. Beginner framework post: 10 Tips you Must Know (filed to basics)
2. Official campaign marker: WATCH AND PLAY FOUNDATION! (filed to events)
3. Event-design reference: Fan Art Contest (filed to events)

## Why not more
Most third-party hits were filtered out due to:
- duplicate aggregation,
- link-only pages,
- unverifiable or stale code claims.

## Redeem-code status
- No newly official-verified codes today.
- Third-party code lists remain unverified and were not promoted to active.

## Editorial policy applied
Quality over volume: this project stores useful guidance, not raw link collections.
