# Spending Advice and Value Analysis

This chapter is not pushing spending.
It answers: if you decide to spend, where is value concentrated?

Free-to-play is viable; light spending mainly improves pace.

## Common purchase entries

Usually in top-right area:

- Hero pass
- Fund-type packs
- Premium card membership
- Weekly/monthly cards
- Limited-time bundles

---

## 1) Hero pass (recommended for beginners)

Earn activity points via dailies; 40,000 points unlock full free rewards. Paid unlock gives extra track rewards.

Better for:

- New players
- Core level below ~20

Value drops for many mid/late players with near-capped hero progress.

---

## 2) Counterattack fund (high value)

Typically low one-time cost with strong resource return.
Often one of the best value purchases.

---

## 3) Premium card membership

Common benefits include:

- Second research queue
- Weekly free discount-shop refresh
- +1 Supreme Prayer ship attempt
- Additional daily limits

Especially valuable for active players with long research timers.

---

## 4) Cumulative recharge events

Do not force extra spending just to hit cumulative thresholds.
Only complete naturally if already near the target.

---

## 5) Weekly vs monthly card

- Monthly card usually higher priority
- Weekly card can help in tight-resource phases

When budget is limited: monthly > weekly.

---

## 6) New-hero flash packs

For ordinary 10-shard-combine heroes: often skippable.
For high-threshold heroes (e.g., 40-shard combine): can be considered selectively.

---

## 7) Activity milestones

In activity panel, Conquest milestone is generally better value than Legend milestone in the source guidance.

---

## Suggested priority

### One-time
1. Counterattack fund
2. Activity milestone (Conquest)

### Recurring
1. Premium card
2. Monthly card
3. Weekly card (if budget allows)
4. Hero pass (beginner stage)

## Core principles

- Don’t spend for cumulative pressure
- Don’t panic-buy shards
- Don’t impulse-spend for rankings
- Prefer long-term return products

Spending is a tool, not the objective.
