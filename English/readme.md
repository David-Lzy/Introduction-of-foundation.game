# MIT2 / HuaXia New Player Growth Handbook

## README

Before reading this handbook, please make sure you meet the following conditions:

* Energy Core level >= 8
* You already have a basic understanding of the game's core systems
* You intend to grow long-term rather than just try the game briefly

This handbook is **not** a "from-zero beginner tutorial."

If this is your first time playing *Foundation: Galactic Frontier*, or you are still exploring the basic features, it is recommended to finish the in-game beginner guide first and review the official materials.

You can access them here:

Tap your avatar in the upper-left corner
→ Select "Galactic Encyclopedia"
→ Read the relevant introductory content

The Galactic Encyclopedia already covers:

* Power composition (Flagship / Fighters / Heroes / Tech / Elites / Buildings)
* Basic resource explanations
* Combat mechanics
* Buildings and mothership systems
* Guild and star map systems

The goal of this handbook is to:

Help players who have entered the core growth stage
Avoid wasting resources
Understand the event cycle
Build the right priority mindset

If your Energy Core has not yet reached level 8+, it is recommended to focus on basic construction first before reading this handbook.

This game is a long-term system.
Growth matters more than impulse.
Rhythm matters more than short bursts.

Welcome to the real growth phase.
