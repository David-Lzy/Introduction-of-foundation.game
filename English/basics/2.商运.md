# Trade System

Trade is one of the most stable resource sources.

Core rule:

**Trade income is directly tied to starport level.**

So moving starport to higher-level planets is critical.

---

## 1) Starport level and reset

After migration to a better planet:

- Trade rewards increase
- Merchant-network rewards increase

Important: trade orders generally need refresh/restart after migration.

---

## 2) Rush orders (daily specials)

You get 3 special orders daily.

You can use tickets to reroll quality.
Suggested keep threshold: purple and above.
Usually reroll white/green orders.

Ticket sources: daily tasks and some event rewards.

---

## 3) Investment

You can invest in guildmates’ trade orders.
Long-term value is positive, especially in active guilds.

Suggested targets: blue/purple/orange quality.

---

## 4) Hack mechanic and alliance rules

Hack is a competitive interaction feature.

Current guild rule in source notes:

- MIT2 and MIT are allies
- Do not hack allied trade routes

Use galaxy map and starbridge paths (white dotted lines) to locate active routes.
Cross-sector hunting can be easier.

---

## 5) Exploration relevance

Unlocking more sectors improves route options and target search.
First-time exploration rewards are also valuable.

---

## 6) Gold order sharing

High-quality orders (e.g., gold) can be shared to guild chat for coordinated actions.

---

## 7) Guild conduct baseline

Source guideline emphasizes:

- Do not attack players actively doing trade runs
- Low gain, high damage, and alliance-risk behavior

If internal violations happen: apologize and compensate.

---

## Summary

Trade has three layers:

1. Resource income
2. Investment cooperation
3. Hack confrontation

Mature guild growth depends on tempo, structure, and coordination—not random harassment.
