# Core Resource Acquisition

Covers water, metal, food, and galaxy coins.

Understanding where resources come from is more important than focusing only on spending.

## 1) Merchant Network (base source)

Location: lower-left area, star-flag icon.

Recommendation:

> Complete as many tasks as possible.

For harder tasks (tribute ships, rallies), if current zone is too hard:

- Fly manually to lower-level sectors
- Kill lower-level targets there

Task checks completion, not target level.

---

## 2) Trade routes (depends on starport level)

Trade return scales with starport level.

Use galaxy map to check home port and station location.

General recommendation:

- Keep home port and station coordinated
- Move to higher-level free planets when possible (commonly Lv5 in current environment)

After migration, trade and merchant-network rewards improve.

## 3) Map-layer understanding

Normal UI is interaction layer.
Galaxy view is strategic layer.

Many targets/features are clearer in galaxy view.
Don’t rely only on auto-jump.

## Summary

Loop:
Merchant Network → Trade → Better starport level/location → Higher returns → Faster progression.

Common mistakes:

- Give up tasks when blocked
- Never relocate to better starports
- Ignore map-layer tools
