# Beginner Priority Framework (Official 10 Tips)

> This is an actionable rewrite based on the official post, not a link pointer.

## Who this is for
- Players entering early-mid progression after level 8
- Players who want fewer resource mistakes
- Players aiming for stable guild/event/PvP growth

## 10 practical priorities
1. **Join an active guild first** (team economy and event leverage matter more than solo pace).
2. **Master style counters**: Beam > Kinetic > Ion > Beam.
3. **Use Encyclopedia Galactica first** before committing upgrades.
4. **Treat map exploration as mandatory daily income**, not optional content.
5. **Focus resources on one active objective**, avoid even-spread upgrades.
6. **Build around flagship + champions + components + tech synergy** per scenario.
7. **Respect timers** (construction, tech, event windows, war declarations).
8. **Port occupation is a mid-game strategic multiplier** (coordination + timing win ports).
9. **Keep learning from high-signal communities** and share concise internal notes.
10. **Bind your account immediately** for security and cross-platform continuity.

## 24-hour execution checklist
- Join/confirm a high-activity guild.
- Prepare at least a second counter-style lineup.
- Run one focused exploration + timer cleanup cycle.
- Re-allocate resources to your current primary objective.
- Bind account in Settings → Account.
