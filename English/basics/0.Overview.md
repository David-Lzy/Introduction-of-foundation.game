# Resource System Notes

Key correction:

**Visible resources are not equal to your true total resources.**

This chapter explains hidden inventory layers and priority management.

---

## 1) Storage view (must check first)

Path: main UI → Storage → bottom-right "Bag Stats"

You can view full assets:

- Metal / water / coins / food
- All speedups (universal, ship, tech, building)

Top-right quick bar does NOT show many bag items, causing false "resource shortage" impressions.

---

## 2) Resource items (hidden bulk)

Bag often contains many unopened resource items.
They are not counted in visible totals until used.

Recommendation:

- Don’t open casually
- Use during events or upgrade spikes

---

## 3) Level chests

Path: Storage → Resources → Chests.

Level chests scale with level.
While waiting can improve chest value, practical strategy is usually to use directly, because growth tempo often outweighs delayed marginal chest gain.

---

## 4) Special resource: universal repair module

Shown in top-right resource panel (not normal storage bag).
Primarily tied to PvP spending.

---

## 5) Action points

Used for wild monsters, bosses, and part of PvE.
Treat as key progression fuel; avoid wasting on low-value targets.

---

## 6) Guild vouchers

Obtained mainly via guild donations.
Used in guild shop for high-value items.

For long-term value, active donation is strongly recommended.

---

## 7) Merit points

From PvP. Used for specific shop/war spending.
Usually a later-stage resource.

---

## Summary

Three layers:

1. Visible resources (top-right)
2. Bag resources (hidden inventory)
3. Structural resources (guild vouchers / merit / action points)

Progression issues are often structure misunderstanding, not raw scarcity.
