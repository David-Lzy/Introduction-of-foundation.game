# Additional Resource Sources

Besides merchant network and trade, there are auxiliary sources.
They are weaker early, stronger later.

---

## 1) Fleet internal production

Three production buildings:

- Water cycle system
- Smelter
- Food processing

Notes:

- Low-level output is limited
- Don’t over-invest early
- Treat as supplementary, not primary

---

## 2) Arena rank rewards

High rank in Glory Arena can grant strong rewards, including high-quality crew chests.

Crew system unlocks at Lv20+, so pre-20 players can ignore.

Some gold crew for food processing can add extra food when storage exceeds thresholds.
Usually hard to obtain (high rank or spending).

---

## 3) Luminous Orb system

Location: bottom-right circular orb icon.

Can provide:

- Food
- Other special rewards

For non-hardcore players, this is often a major food source after trade.

Suggested: clear daily attempts whenever possible.

### Optional combat tip

A common setup:

- 1 shield melee
- 2 ranged DPS

Kite while attacking (movement + fire).
Skillful play can clear slightly deeper layers.
