# Beginner Priority Framework (Official 10 Tips)

## Source-read + comparison outcome
I reviewed the full official article (`10 Tips you Must Know`) and compared it with existing project docs (resources, trade, active farming, early progression).

## Why this stays
This article adds value as a **beginner framework hub** rather than a single tip:
1. Connects scattered topics into one priority flow: guild -> resource focus -> timers/war windows -> exploration.
2. Adds account-binding/safety guidance (underrepresented in current docs).
3. Works as a top-level entry page for new readers.

## Actionable distilled points
- Join an active guild on day 1 for compounding alliance gains.
- Avoid even-spread investment; focus resources on core progression goals.
- Check event timers/war windows daily to avoid missing high-value cycles.
- Bind account early to reduce progress-loss risk.

## Quality gate
- Not a link dump: ✅
- Adds net-new structure/value: ✅
- Actionable: ✅
