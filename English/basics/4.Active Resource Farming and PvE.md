# Active Resource Farming (PvE Focus)

Core active methods:

- Kill wild targets
- Fight players (PvP)

This chapter focuses on PvE wild targets.

---

## 1) No-action-cost target: Supreme Prayer Ship

Location: Atonement Harbor (name may vary by language).

This is the unique map target that does not consume action points.

Daily attempts:

- Normal: 3
- Premium membership: 4

Rule:

> Fight the highest level you can handle.

Higher levels improve fragment quality/probabilities and other growth materials.

Daily clear also grants guild currency (source note: 2500).

---

## 2) Action-point targets

Action points are shown under avatar (green bar), commonly cap 300 and regenerate hourly.

Refill items:

- Blue +10
- Purple +100
- Gold +200

Suggestion:

- Don’t burn too many potions in routine days
- Save for event windows when scoring is better

## 3) Supreme Church tribute ships

Cost: 30 action points.
Drops include water/metal/food/galaxy coin and occasional ship fragments.

Hidden food scaling is tied to Counterattack progression/reputation.
Higher reputation can boost food gain and daily chest value.

---

## 4) Minions

Square map icons.
Cost: 10 action points.
Lower baseline value than tribute ships, but first-kill rewards are useful.

First-kill rewards may include silver hero shards and training manuals.

---

## 5) Rally risk control

High-level tribute ships often require rallies.
Enable guild auto-AI support when available.

If rally is not winnable:

- Open Guild → Rally
- Tap cancel (X)

This can stop losses, save action points, and avoid ship destruction/return downtime.

## Summary

Active farming structure:

1. Prayer ship (free attempts)
2. Tribute ship (high value)
3. Minions (first-kill value)
4. Rally cooperation

Efficiency comes from target level selection, hidden bonus use, and loss control.
