# VS Guild Duel Strategy

VS is a weekly key event.
It is a 6-day tempo battle of resources and execution between two guilds.

---

## Basic rules

- Total duration: 6 days
- Different scoring focus each day
- Daily wins grant points
- Final result by total points on Day 6
- Winner upgrades reward pool tier
- New members usually cannot score within first 24h after joining

---

## Core idea

VS is not about random daily spending.

> Stockpile first, release on the correct day.

---

## Daily focus

- **Day 1:** building/shipbuilding acceleration, trade, Supreme targets, rallies
- **Day 2:** hero level/star/shard spending and commissions
- **Day 3:** research speedups, Deep Space Beacon, Echo modules
- **Day 4:** flagship upgrades/advancement/blueprints/core consumption
- **Day 5:** mixed growth burst (building/research/shipbuilding/heroes/rallies)
- **Day 6:** PvP confrontation (enemy aircraft/flagship/core damage)

## Tempo discipline

Common mistake:

- Spend everything during normal days
- Have nothing to burst during VS

Correct approach:

- Hold key resources daily
- Concentrate release in scoring windows

Key stockpile items:

- Speedups
- Galaxy coins
- Hero shards
- Beacons
- Echo modules
- Food

---

## Guild-level operation

Leadership should:

1. Announce daily themes early
2. Coordinate release timing
3. Plan Day-6 combat rhythm
4. Avoid meaningless conflict

Day-6 PvP should stay controlled and coordinated where possible.

## One-line summary

VS is a competition of resource scheduling ability, not just raw combat power.
