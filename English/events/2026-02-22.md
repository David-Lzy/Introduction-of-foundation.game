# 2026-02-22 Increment | events (cleaned)

## Source-read + comparison outcome
Both official posts were read and compared against existing event content:
- WATCH AND PLAY FOUNDATION!
- Fan Art Contest: Design Challenge

## Why they stay
### 1) WATCH AND PLAY FOUNDATION!
Useful as an **official campaign timing marker**:
- helps reconstruct promotion cadence,
- helps align event timelines in project docs.

### 2) Fan Art Contest
Useful as a **reusable event template reference**:
- reward tiering model,
- submission-rule framing,
- channel routing pattern.

## What was discarded
- Low-signal reposts and pure-link pages with no new mechanics or operational detail.

## Quality gate
- Not a link dump: ✅
- Net-new value: ✅ (timeline + event design pattern)
- Reusable for docs: ✅
