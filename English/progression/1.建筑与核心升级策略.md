# Building and Core Upgrade Strategy

The building system is the main axis of progression.

Wrong approach:

> Upgrade all buildings evenly.

Right approach:

> Push around the core, keep others as support.

## Core-first principle

Location: bottom-right → Building icon

Core level determines:

- Unlocks
- Progression cap
- Access to some systems

### Simple but effective

Before core upgrade:

- Upgrade only required prerequisite buildings
- Ignore the rest

After core upgrade:

- Handle the next prerequisite round

This is the highest-efficiency loop.

### Short-timer upgrade window

If a newly unlocked building has very short timers (1–5 min), chain-upgrade it until timers reach 1–2 hours, then return to core-first.

### Guild help

Use Help during upgrades; guildmates can shorten timers.

## Shipyard breakpoint mechanic

The leftmost three shipyards:

- Kinetic
- Beam
- Ion

They scale by breakpoints:

> Every 5 levels is a major jump.

Example: Lv24 can build T4 ships, Lv25 unlocks T5 immediately.

## Resource production buildings

Includes water, smelting, and food processing.

Good for casual players logging in 2–3 times daily.
Highly active players should not prioritize them early.

---

## Speedup usage

### Before core Lv15

Use speedups aggressively:

- Short timers
- High efficiency
- Faster snowball

### After core Lv20

Timers become days/weeks, speedup value drops.

Recommended:

- Hoard speedups
- Use during VS / guild battles / ranking events

Early game = fast growth
Late game = tempo control

## Hidden gain: Rian

At the lower-left of the core building, talk to NPC **Rian** daily for:

- 50 action points

Also claim other NPC dialogue rewards when available.

## Summary

Three key questions:

1. Who to upgrade first
2. Whether to use speedups now
3. Whether to rush breakpoint levels

Core rules:

- Core first
- Watch shipyard breakpoints
- Resource buildings depend on activity style
- Use speedups by phase
