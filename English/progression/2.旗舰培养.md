# Flagship Development

This chapter covers flagship (hull) and component development: role positioning, cost-efficient upgrades, component choices, and upgrade logic.

---

## 1) Roles of the three flagships

Common ships:

- Gramore (starter)
- Danmosel (usually from newbie rewards/sign-in)
- Opportunity

### Opportunity: trade-specialized

Has trade-oriented passive effects (about +30% fleet movement speed during commerce), ideal for daily trade routes.

### Danmosel: combat-oriented

Generally better for fighting.

### Practical split

- 2 ships for trade (including Opportunity)
- 1 ship for combat or guild rally support

---

## 2) Flagship level cap

Flagship level is capped by energy core level.

Example: Core Lv24 usually means flagship max Lv24.

---

## 3) Galaxy coin bottleneck

Mid/late flagship upgrades are split into sub-slots and consume huge galaxy coins (often millions per slot).

Conclusion: galaxy coins are a long-term hard bottleneck.

---

## 4) Event tempo (Lv20+)

For Lv20+ players, many events score specific upgrade actions by day.

Best practice:

> Save flagship/component upgrades for the matching event day.

---

## 5) Component priorities

Path: Flagship → select ship → Components.

Typical 5 components: radar / central core / railgun / armor / thruster.

Priority:

> Central energy core first, then others.

For beginners: green set is enough as a bridge; Lv4–5 is usable.

### Build archetypes

Central core influences your combat archetype (usually 3 schools).
Heroes also follow corresponding schools.

For non-heavy spenders:

- Try using different archetypes across 3 flagships
- Spread hero investment across 3 schools to avoid one-school lock

---

## 6) Component materials

Mainly from high-level Supreme Church targets and action-point PvE.

Rule:

> Farm the highest level you can handle for better drops and shard quality.

---

## 7) Advancement and rarity

Advancement shards are expensive and slow.
Do not force it; upgrade naturally when fragments come.

Purple components are not trash:

- Can be strong mid-game bridges
- Breakthrough at higher levels can be a major jump
- May outperform low-level gold pieces temporarily

---

## 8) Upgrade pattern

Because upgrade cost grows faster than stat gain, long-term value is usually from **balanced upgrades** across all 5 components (with slight early lead on central core).

---

## Summary

- Split 3 ships by role
- Respect energy-core cap
- Plan around galaxy-coin bottleneck
- Save key upgrades for event scoring days
- Central core sets archetype
- Farm high-level targets
- Don’t force advancement
- Use balanced component growth mid/late
