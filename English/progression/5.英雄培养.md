# Hero Development

Heroes are a major part of combat power. Wrong investment direction wastes food and shards heavily.

This chapter covers:

- Acquisition
- Level/star growth
- Skill linkage
- Resource allocation
- Light-spend suggestions

---

## 1) How to get heroes

- Mainline gifts provide some heroes early
- Recruitment building level shortens free recruitment interval

Do not over-invest in recruitment building only for interval reduction.

---

## 2) Priority: gold heroes first

Rule:

> Prioritize gold 5-star heroes.

Purple heroes are for transition; avoid heavy long-term spending on them unless no good gold options exist.

---

## 3) Level cap linkage

Hero max level is tied to energy core level.
Late game often has food surplus but level cap bottleneck.

---

## 4) Recommended roster size

Each flagship uses 3 heroes.
3 ships = 9 heroes.

Recommended:

> Invest in 9 core heroes only.

---

## 5) Purple hero note

Clara (system-given) is often efficient due to easier shard access.
Some other purple heroes can stay as short-term bridge only.

---

## 6) Stars and skills

Growth has two axes:

1. Levels (food)
2. Stars (shards)

Skill level caps are tied to star level, so star upgrades matter.

---

## 7) Rare shard heroes

For heroes with very rare shards, avoid pre-hoarding all resources.
Wait until acquisition is real, then decide investment.

---

## 8) Hero pass (light spending)

Path: top-right event icon.
Complete dailies for activity points; paid track grants extra shards/rewards.

Usually high value for newer players with low star heroes.

---

## 9) Food usage tempo

- Early game: invest steadily
- Mid/late: keep reserves

Reason: some events (e.g., VS) score upgrade consumption on specific days.

---

## 10) Luminous-orb relation

Luminous Orb is an important food source. Do it daily when possible.

---

## Summary

1. Gold first
2. Raise 9 core heroes
3. Purple = transition
4. Star level gates skills
5. Use food by phase
6. Hero pass is often good value for beginners
