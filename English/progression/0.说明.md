## 1) Mainline Task System

Mainline tasks are:

> One-time resources and growth rewards.

They are different from daily repeatable tasks.

So they are better categorized as progression advancement, not daily resource farming.

### Counterattack Operations

Location: top-left → Counterattack

Features:

- Chapter-based advancement
- Reputation level growth
- Extra bonus unlocks

Examples of impact:

- Supreme Church food bonus
- Better daily chest rewards

This is both a story system and a long-term bonus system.

### Activity System (daily advancement)

Location: bottom-left → Activity

Complete daily tasks to gain activity points and claim staged rewards.

### Activity Milestones (paid-enhanced)

Includes:

- Free reward track
- Paid extra reward track

Paid track gives additional gains on each claim.

This belongs to light spending optimization (covered in the spending chapter).
