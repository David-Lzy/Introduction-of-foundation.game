# Guild Management Notes

For guild leadership and officers.

Includes:

- Marking and coordination
- Member operations
- Tech guidance
- Management tools

---

## 1) Guild markers

Use markers for:

- Attack targets
- Rally points
- Resource points
- Strategic direction

Important targets should always be marked, not only written in text.

---

## 2) Guild list awareness

Track:

- Other guilds
- Allies
- Potential rivals

Use this for regional situation awareness.

---

## 3) Member management

In Members page:

- Recruitment settings
- Donation ranking (trophy icon)

Donation rankings help enforce participation and remind inactive contributors.

---

## 4) Guild mail

Leaders can send mail to all members or officer group.
Use for:

- Event reminders
- Battle plans
- Tech direction
- Internal announcements

---

## 5) Admin functions

Management panel commonly includes:

- Recommended tech settings
- Voting tools
- Advanced management options

Concentrated tech push is more efficient than average spreading.

---

## 6) New Port placement reminder

Keep guild New Port on high-level planets whenever possible.

Why:

- Better trade returns
- Better merchant network value
- Faster overall development

---

## 7) Donation policy and gifts

Donations should be continuous because returns are long-term and high.
Guild gifts can come from spending, tribute ship kills, or events.

No forced spending policy; encourage within personal means.

---

## 8) War declaration / PvP

Guild war and area PvP details belong to PvP chapter.

---

## Summary

- Command with markers
- Guide with recommended tech
- Track member contribution
- Standardize New Port placement
- Keep communication transparent

Strong guilds are built by operating structure, not by a single player.
