# Mainline Push and Exploration Expansion

This chapter covers:

1. Mainline tasks
2. Counterattack operations
3. Planet expansion and map exploration

---

## Mainline tasks

Mainline is linear and one-time.
Choice differences are usually minor.

Conclusion:

> Follow the flow; don’t overthink branch choices.

---

## Counterattack operations

Location: top-left → Counterattack

Nature:

> A power-check system.

If power is enough, clear it. If not, stop forcing it.

- Boss appears every 10 stages
- Boss stages require manual play
- Normal stages can be auto-managed (entrance +托管)

For beginners, return after power growth and clear efficiently.

---

## Daily activity (must-do)

Location: bottom-left → Activity

Suggested targets:

- Daily activity: 140
- Weekly tasks: 330

Later rewards have weaker efficiency.

Milestones include free and paid tracks.
Value recommendation: Conquest milestone usually better than Legend milestone.

---

## Hidden progression: map expansion

Often overlooked but important.

### Planet unlock

When planets are blocked by Supreme Church, clear blockade first.

Recommended large-scale expansion around ship level ~20 for easier overpower clears.

### Efficiency tip

Use travel time (e.g., 30s warp) to finish quick tasks/events in parallel.

### When to pause

If monster level is too high and cannot be overpowered efficiently, pause expansion temporarily.

## Exploration progress rewards

Path: bottom-right → Map icon → sector map.

At exploration progress 150, you can claim rewards (e.g., silver hero shards).

Suggestion:

> In each new sector, push exploration to 150 as routine.

## Summary

- Mainline: push naturally
- Counterattack: power-gated
- Daily activity: complete reliably
- Expansion: do it when overpowering is possible
- Exploration 150: stable reward checkpoint
