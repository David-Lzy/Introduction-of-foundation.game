# Guild Introduction

Guild is one of the core systems for mid/long-term growth.
Not joining a guild means giving up major value.

This chapter covers:

- Donations & tech
- New Port rewards
- Rally/help systems
- Shop exchange priorities

---

## Core modules

Path: main UI → top-right → Guild

Main sections:

- Tech
- New Port
- Rally
- Help
- Shop
- Members

---

## Tech donations (must do)

Donate water/metal in Tech.

Why mandatory:

- Water/metal often overflow later
- Upgrade timers become very long
- Donation returns are stable and compounding

Follow guild-recommended tech (like-marked items), avoid random scattered donations.

---

## New Port income

If guild controls sectors, claim daily:

- Water
- Metal
- Galaxy coins

---

## Rally and help

Enable auto-join rally when possible; assign your highest power fleet.

Use help for tech/build timers—it is mutually beneficial.

---

## Guild shop

Currency: guild vouchers.

Main sources:

- Donations
- Guild help
- Guild gifts
- Daily Supreme prayer ship reward
- Event rewards

Early game, avoid spending too much on water/metal.
Fighting-focused players usually prioritize universal repair modules and legendary training manuals.

Weekly refresh priority:

- Deep Space Beacon (high priority)
- Lv20+ consider Echo modules / Deep Space Echo
- Other optional: galaxy coins / speedups / potion items

---

## Summary

1. Donate consistently
2. Follow recommended tech direction
3. Spend vouchers with structure
4. Prioritize key weekly items
5. Ignore advanced systems too early

Guild is a resource amplifier; structure beats raw stockpile.
